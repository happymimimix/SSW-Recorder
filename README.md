When comes to musical scores, Singer Song Writer 10 Pro, also SSW for short, is the most popular choice in the black midi community for this task. 
Although the software is already the most efficient one among all other similar software that people can find on the internet, it’s still way less than enough for black midis. 
It becomes laggy as a s**t with only 10k notes. 
People often have to remove the overlaps or unblack their midi before they can make a video with it. 
Even when we’ve done overlaps removing and unblacking, Singer Song Writer still lags a lot as it’s not meant to be used as a black midi player. 
And most importantly, you must merge all the tracks and channels in your midi into one because SSW puts different tracks on different rows! 
Too bad that black midi pieces often have many hundreds or even thousands of tracks which make the sheet extremely long in its height, I need to scroll through an extraordinarily long distance to view all the tracks and of course that’s not what people wanted. 
Having everything displayed in one row is a lot nicer and neater but takes a large amount of extra work to merge hundreds and thousands of these tracks into one. 

Now with SSW Recorder that I’ve created, this is completely different! 
I first made a fully automatic midi track and channel merger that is well optimized to the best of my ability and is capable of handling large black midis. The track merging task can now be done within minutes instead of hours! 
Did I just stop with a simple track merger? Of course not!
